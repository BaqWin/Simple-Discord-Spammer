# Simple-Discord-Spammer
This repository contains a Python script designed to automate the sending of messages to discord server channels.
It is intended for educational purposes only.

## How does it work?

1. Provide token authorization into veriable `headers` into field named `token`
2. Add the channel ID(s) by `(right-clicking on the channel name) -> 'Copy Channel ID.'` Then, paste the copied ID(s) into the `channel_IDs` list. You can include one or multiple IDs.
3. (Optional) Adjust the `loop_amount` parameter to specify how many messages you want to send to each channel.
4. Lastly, update the `text.txt` file with the message you want to send. The file can include multiple lines of text.
